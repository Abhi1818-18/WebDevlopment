The user enters a city name in the input field and clicks the search button.
The event listener triggers, calling the checkWeather function with the entered city name.
The checkWeather function sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, receives weather data, and updates the display with the weather information.
If there's an error or the city is not found, an appropriate message is displayed.
When the page loads, an initial weather check is performed with a default city to display weather information right away.
This code provides a simple Weather App that allows users to check the weather for different cities.
